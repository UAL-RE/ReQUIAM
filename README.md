## Overview

This identity and access management (IAM) software performs the following for
the [University of Arizona's Research Data Repository (ReDATA)](https://arizona.figshare.com):
 1. It conducts EDS queries to retrieve classification information
    (e.g., student, staff, and/or faculty) and association with
    organization codes (i.e., departments/colleges)
 2. Based on classification information and primary organization
    association, it sets `ismemberof` [Grouper](https://www.incommon.org/software/grouper/) membership

The Grouper memberships are as follow:
 1. The allowed user quota for upload (in bytes), determined by the user's
    classification, is set by Grouper `figshare:quota:<value>` group
 2. The "research theme/portal", determined by the user's organizational
    affiliation, is set by Grouper `figshare:portal:<value>` group

For the latter, these portals and their association with University
organization code(s) are defined within this
[CSV file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ualibraries/ReQUIAM_csv/master/requiam_csv/data/research_themes.csv).

Note that access is granted to the service through membership in a Grouper
`figshare:active` group.  These memberships are done indirectly based on
other Grouper membership set forth by University Library privileges.

This software is based on the [existing patron software](https://github.com/ualibraries/patron-groups)
developed for the [University of Arizona Libraries](https://new.library.arizona.edu/).

An illustration of the service architecture workflow is provided below.

## Getting Started

These instructions will have the code running on your local or virtual machine.


### Requirements

You will need the following to have a working copy of this software. See
[installation](#installation-instructions) steps:
1. Python (3.7.5)
2. [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) ([0.25.3](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.25.3/))
3. [`ldap3`](https://ldap3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (2.6.1)
4. [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) (2.22.0)
5. [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/doc/) ([1.18.0](https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/))

### Installation Instructions

#### Python and setting up a `conda` environment

First, install a working version of Python (v3.7.5).  We recommend using the
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) package installer.

After you have Anaconda installed, you will want to create a separate `conda` environment
and activate it:

```
$ (sudo) conda create -n figshare_patrons python=3.7.5
$ conda activate figshare_patrons
```

Next, clone this repository into a parent folder:

```
(figshare_patrons) $ cd /path/to/parent/folder
(figshare_patrons) $ git clone https://github.com/ualibraries/ReQUIAM.git
```

With the activated `conda` environment, you can install with the `setup.py` script:

```
(figshare_patrons) $ cd /path/to/parent/folder/ReQUIAM
(figshare_patrons) $ (sudo) python setup.py develop
```

This will automatically installed the required `pandas`, `ldap3`, `requests`, and `numpy` packages.

You can confirm installation via `conda list`

```
(figshare_patrons) $ conda list requiam
```

You should see that the version is `0.15.1`.

### Configuration Settings

Configuration settings are specified through the [config/figshare.ini](config/figshare.ini) file.
The most important settings to set are those populated with `***override***`.
However, for our scripts, these settings can be specified using multi-character 
flag options, such as `--ldap_password`.
Note that most `figshare.ini` settings can be overwritten through the command line.

For manual override (v0.11.0) where IAM portal and quota settings differ from
norm, `config` will include two CSV templates for portal and quota to specify
those changes.


### Testing Installation

To test the installation without performing any `portal` or `quota` query,
execute the following command:

```
(figshare_patrons) $ export password="insert_password"
(figshare_patrons) $ export persist_path="/path/to/persistent/storage"
(figshare_patrons) $ ./scripts/script_run --config config/figshare.ini \
                       --persistent_path $persist_path \
                       --ldap_password $password --grouper_password $password
```

Test command-line flags (`test` and `test_reverse`) are available to test EDS
query and Grouper synchronization (with the `sync` flag) by executing the following :

```
(figshare_patrons) $ ./scripts/script_run --test \
                       --config config/figshare.ini --persistent_path $persist_path \
                       --ldap_password $password --grouper_password $password --sync
```

Note that the above will add a test NetID account to the following Grouper
group: `arizona.edu:dept:LBRY:figshare:test`

Without the `sync` flag, the above command line will perform a
"dry run". It will indicate what Grouper updates will occur.

To undo this change, use the `test_reverse` flag:

```
(figshare_patrons) $ ./scripts/script_run --test_reverse \
                       --config config/figshare.ini --persistent_path $persist_path \
                       --ldap_password $password --grouper_password $password --sync
```

## Execution

To execute the script and update Grouper and EDS, include the `portal`, `quota`,
and `sync` command-line flags:

```
(figshare_patrons) $ ./scripts/script_run --config config/figshare.ini \
                       --persistent_path $persist_path \
                       --ldap_password $password --grouper_password $password \
                       --quota --portal --sync
```

Note: Without the `sync` flag, the above command line will perform a
"dry run" where both `quota` and `portal` queries are conducted. It will
indicate what Grouper updates will occur.

By default, changes occur on the `figshare` stem. Execution can occur on the
`figtest` stem with the `--grouper_figtest` boolean flag.

There are additional options to run a subset of portals or organization codes.
This is specified with the `--org_codes` or `--groups` options, which accepts
comma-separated inputs. For this to work, the `--portal` must be set. If
`--quota` is specified, those users are added to the appropriate group.
Note that with this option, it will create and populate a `figtest:group_active`
group that allows for indirect membership association. There are a couple of
interactive prompts to create the `figtest:group_active` group or provide an
existing one to use/update.


### Manual Changes

While the primary use of this software is automated updates through Grouper,
there are additional scripts for handling.  One of those pertains to overriding
default changes (e.g., a user's quota, involvement with a specific portal).
To this end, the `user_update` script should be used. It has several features:
 1. It can add a number of users to a specific group and also remove them from
    its previous group assignment(s)
 2. It will update the appropriate CSV files. This ensures that the changes
    stay when the automated script `script_run` is executed.
 3. It has the ability to move a user to the "main" or "root" portal
 4. It has a number of built-in error handling to identify possible input error.
    This includes:
       - A username that is not valid
       - A Grouper group that does not exist
       - Prevent any action if the user belongs to the specified group

Execution can be done as follows:

```
(figshare_patrons) $ ./scripts/user_update --config config/figshare.ini \
                       --persistent_path $persist_path \
                       --ldap_password $password --grouper_password $password \
                       --quota 123456 --portal testportal --netid <username> --sync
```
Here, the script will update the specified `<username>` to be associated with
the `123456` quota and the `testportal` portal.  Much like `script_run`,
execution requires the `--sync` flag. Otherwise, a list of changes will be
provided. Note: `<username>` can be a list of comma-separated users
(e.g., `user1,user2,user3`) or a .txt file with each username on a new line.
```
user1
user2
user3
```

To remove a user from its current assignment and place it on the main portal,
use: `--portal root`. For quota, the `root` option will remove any quota
association (this is equivalent to a zero quota)

The manual CSV files are specified in the config file:
```
# Manual override files
portal_file = config/portal_manual.csv
quota_file = config/quota_manual.csv
```

These settings, much like other settings (see `python requiam/user_update --help`),
can be overwritten on the command line:
  ```
  --portal_file /path/to/portal_manual.csv
  --quota_file /path/to/quota_manual.csv
  ```
Note that working templates are provided in the config folder for
[quota](config/quota_manual_template.csv) and [portal](config/portal_manual_template.csv).

To disable updating the the manual CSV files, you can include the following flags:

`--portal_file_noupdate --quota_file_noupdate`

By default, changes occur on the `figshare` stem. Execution can occur on the
`figtest` stem with the `--grouper_figtest` boolean flag.


### API Management of Grouper Groups

The `add_grouper_groups` currently create and assign privileges to groups
through the Grouper API.  It uses the above existing Google Sheet for research
themes and sub-portals. In addition, another
[Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Rhfpz4aWIcOGOOu0Ev4sZNMiXvLr3FSl_83yRd3h4k/edit?usp=sharing)
exists for the quotas. The script will check whether a group exists.  If the
`add` flag is provided, it will create the group and assign privileges for
GrouperSuperAdmins and GrouperAdmins. If a group already exists, it will
skip to the privilege assignments.  To execute the script:

```
(figshare_patrons) $ ./scripts/add_grouper_groups --config config/figshare.ini \
                       --persistent_path $persist_path --grouper_password $password \
                       --main_themes --sub_portals --quota --add
```

The `main_themes`, `sub_portals` and `quota` flags will conduct checks and
create those sets of groups.  Without the `add` flag, it is a dry run.  By
default this works on a testing Grouper stem `figtest`.  Set the `production`
flag to implement on the production stem, `figshare`.

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available,
see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/ualibraries/ReQUIAM/tags).

## Continuous Integration

Initially we started using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com); however, due
to the change in
[pricing for open-source repositories](https://travis-ci.community/t/org-com-migration-unexpectedly-comes-with-a-plan-change-for-oss-what-exactly-is-the-new-deal/10567),
we decided to use
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions).
Currently, there are two GitHub Action workflows:
1. A "Create release" workflow, [`create-release.yml`](.github/workflows/create-release.yml)
   for new releases when a tag is pushed
2. A "Python package" workflow, [`python-package.yml`](.github/workflows/python-package.yml)
   for builds and tests
